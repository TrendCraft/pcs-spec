Status: Draft
Intended Status: Standards Track
Updates: RFC-PCS-0001, RFC-PCS-0002, RFC-PCS-0003, RFC-PCS-0004, RFC-PCS-0005
Expires: TBD

1. Abstract
This document defines the Persistra Cognitive Standard (PCS) Certification Program, including certification levels, certification processes, certification marks, and permitted usage.

The PCS Certification Program establishes a uniform mechanism for verifying, communicating, and maintaining conformance with PCS specifications.

2. Motivation
As PCS adoption grows, it becomes necessary to:
Provide objective proof of PCS conformance
Enable procurement and compliance validation
Prevent misleading or false claims of PCS compatibility
Ensure interoperability and architectural integrity

Certification marks provide a clear, enforceable signal of compliance without mandating a specific implementation.

3. Scope
This document governs:
Certification eligibility and process
Certification levels (PCS-L1 through PCS-L4)
Certification mark usage and restrictions
This document does not mandate participation in the PCS Certification Program.

4. Definitions
Certification Authority (CA): The entity authorized to grant PCS certification
Certified Implementation: An implementation that has passed PCS-CTS
Certification Mark: A registered mark indicating PCS compliance
Conformance Suite: PCS-CTS as defined in RFC-PCS-0004
Normative language follows RFC 2119.

5. Certification Authority
5.1 Authority Designation
Persistra Inc. is the initial and sole Certification Authority for PCS.

The Certification Authority is responsible for:
Administering certification testing
Issuing certification marks
Maintaining certification records
Revoking certification where necessary

5.2 Delegation
The Certification Authority MAY delegate testing or auditing functions to approved third parties.

Final certification decisions remain with the Certification Authority.

6. Certification Levels
PCS certification corresponds directly to PCS conformance levels:
Level Description
PCS-L1Persistent cognitive state and session continuity
PCS-L2Deterministic policy enforcement and governance
PCS-L3Cross-model cognitive continuity (CMCC)
PCS-L4Federated and distributed cognitive state

An implementation MAY be certified at one or more levels.

7. Certification Process
7.1 Application
Applicants MUST submit:
Implementation description
Declared PCS level(s)
PCS-CTS execution artifacts
Version identifiers

7.2 Testing
Certification requires successful execution of:
PCS-CTS corresponding to declared level(s)
CMCC tests for PCS-L3 or higher

7.3 Attestation
Upon successful testing, the Certification Authority SHALL issue:
A certification attestation
Authorization to use applicable certification marks

8. Certification Marks
8.1 Mark Definitions
Authorized certification marks include:
“PCS-L1 Certified”
“PCS-L2 Certified”
“PCS-L3 Certified”
“PCS-L4 Certified”
Marks MAY include graphical or textual variants.

8.2 Permitted Use
Certified implementations MAY:
Display applicable PCS certification marks
Reference certification in documentation and marketing

Usage MUST accurately reflect the certified level.

8.3 Prohibited Use
Certification marks MUST NOT be used:
Without valid certification
For uncertified versions or configurations
In a misleading or comparative manner
To imply endorsement beyond certification

Unauthorized use constitutes trademark infringement.

9. Certification Validity and Renewal
9.1 Validity Period
PCS certification is valid for a defined period (e.g., 12 months).

9.2 Re-Certification
Re-certification is REQUIRED when:
PCS version changes materially
Implementation changes affect PCS behavior
Certification expires

10. Revocation
The Certification Authority MAY revoke certification if:
Conformance is no longer maintained
Certification marks are misused
Material misrepresentation occurs

Revocation SHALL require removal of certification marks.

11. Fees
Certification MAY involve fees determined by the Certification Authority.
Fees MAY vary based on:
Organization size
Certification level
Scope of evaluation

Fee structures SHOULD be transparent and non-discriminatory.

12. Relationship to Patents
12.1 Certification vs Licensing
PCS certification does not grant patent licenses.
Patent licensing, where required, is separate and governed independently.

12.2 Disclosure
Implementers are responsible for ensuring appropriate patent licenses for PCS implementation.

13. Security and Auditability
Certified implementations SHOULD:
Preserve PCS-CTS audit artifacts
Support independent verification
Protect provenance and policy records

14. Governance
The PCS Spec Editor maintains authority over:
Certification criteria interpretation
Certification mark definitions
Program updates
Changes to certification rules SHALL be published.

15. IANA Considerations
This document defines no IANA actions.

16. Conclusion
The PCS Certification Program enables trustworthy adoption of persistent cognitive systems while preserving architectural freedom.

Certification provides clarity without mandating implementation, and trust without surrendering control.
