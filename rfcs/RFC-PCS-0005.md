PCS Reference Implementation Requirements
Status: Draft
Intended Status: Standards Track
Updates: RFC-PCS-0001, RFC-PCS-0002, RFC-PCS-0003, RFC-PCS-0004
Expires: TBD

1. Abstract
This document defines the requirements and constraints for a Persistra Cognitive Standard (PCS) Reference Implementation.

The PCS Reference Implementation provides a canonical, non-normative realization of PCS specifications intended to:
Demonstrate PCS feasibility
Clarify ambiguous implementation details
Establish baseline behavioral expectations
Support conformance testing and certification

This document explicitly distinguishes reference behavior from normative requirements.

2. Motivation
Open standards require reference implementations to ensure consistent interpretation and interoperability.

However, reference implementations that expose internal architecture risk:
Fragmentation through forks
De facto standard capture by third parties
Uncontrolled propagation of patented mechanisms

RFC-PCS-0005 defines a reference implementation model that balances:
Transparency
Reproducibility
Architectural neutrality
Intellectual property protection

3. Scope
This document applies to any implementation designated as a PCS Reference Implementation.

It does not mandate that PCS adopters use the Reference Implementation.

4. Definitions
Reference Implementation (RI): A canonical, illustrative implementation
Normative Requirement: A MUST/SHALL condition from PCS RFCs
Behavioral Equivalence: Observable output consistency
Internal Mechanism: Implementation-specific internal logic
Normative language follows RFC 2119.

5. Role of the PCS Reference Implementation
The PCS Reference Implementation exists to:
Demonstrate PCS compliance pathways
Validate PCS-CTS conformance expectations
Serve as interoperability benchmark
Reduce ambiguity in PCS interpretation

The Reference Implementation does not define PCS requirements.

6. Reference Implementation Requirements
6.1 Behavioral Fidelity
The Reference Implementation MUST:
Exhibit PCS-compliant external behavior
Pass PCS-CTS tests for PCS-L1 through PCS-L4 (where supported)
Enforce CMCC invariants

6.2 Architectural Non-Normativity
The Reference Implementation MUST NOT:
Impose internal architecture requirements
Define mandatory data structures
Prescribe algorithmic strategies

7. Implementation Boundaries
7.1 Observable Interfaces
The Reference Implementation MUST expose:
PCS-compliant APIs
Deterministic policy enforcement behavior
Provenance generation interfaces

7.2 Internal Opacity
Internal mechanisms MAY be:
Abstracted
Stubbed
Modularized

Implementers MUST NOT assume internal mechanisms are required for compliance.

8. Licensing Model
The PCS Reference Implementation MAY be released under a permissive software license.
Such licensing:
Applies only to source code
Does not grant patent rights
Does not confer PCS certification

9. Relationship to PCS-CTS
The Reference Implementation:
MUST pass PCS-CTS at declared levels
SHOULD be used to validate PCS-CTS updates
MAY serve as regression benchmark
PCS-CTS remains authoritative for compliance determination.

10. Versioning and Stability
10.1 Version Alignment
The Reference Implementation MUST declare:
PCS version supported
PCS-CTS version used
CMCC version enforced

10.2 Stability Guarantees
Backward compatibility SHOULD be maintained where feasible.

11. Prohibited Uses
The PCS Reference Implementation MUST NOT be:
Marketed as PCS certification
Represented as the only compliant implementation
Used to claim PCS compliance without passing PCS-CTS

12. Intellectual Property Considerations
12.1 Patent Scope
Implementation of PCS features MAY require licenses to patents held by Persistra or other parties.

12.2 No Implied License
Use of the Reference Implementation does NOT grant:
Patent licenses
Certification rights
Trademark rights

13. Security Considerations
The Reference Implementation SHOULD:
Isolate test and production modes
Protect provenance and audit artifacts
Prevent tampering with conformance evidence

14. Governance
Designation of an implementation as an official PCS Reference Implementation is controlled by the PCS Spec Editor.

Multiple reference implementations MAY exist.

15. IANA Considerations
This document defines no IANA actions.

16. Conclusion
The PCS Reference Implementation provides a shared point of reference without constraining innovation or surrendering control.

It enables ecosystem growth while preserving architectural independence.
