RFC-PCS-0007

Patent Disclosure and FRAND Licensing Framework
Status: Proposed
Intended Status: Standards Track
Updates: RFC-PCS-0001 through RFC-PCS-0006
Reference: PATENT_NOTICE.md
Expires: TBD

1. Abstract
This document defines the Patent Disclosure and Licensing Framework applicable to implementations of the Persistra Cognitive Standard (PCS).

The framework establishes transparency regarding essential intellectual property, clarifies the relationship between PCS conformance and patent rights, and describes a Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) licensing approach intended to support broad adoption while preserving innovation incentives.

2. Motivation
Persistent cognitive state systems introduce novel architectural mechanisms that may be subject to patent protection.

A clear and explicit patent disclosure framework is necessary to:
Enable informed implementation decisions
Reduce uncertainty for implementers
Avoid post-deployment licensing disputes
Encourage adoption through predictable licensing terms

This document exists to promote clarity, not to restrict participation.

3. Scope
This document applies to:
Implementations claiming PCS conformance
Implementations seeking PCS certification
Implementations incorporating PCS-defined mechanisms
This document does not mandate licensing, nor does it assert infringement.

4. Definitions
Essential Patent: A patent or patent application containing one or more claims that are necessarily infringed by implementing one or more normative (“MUST” or “REQUIRED”) requirements of the Persistra Cognitive Standard, where no technically feasible, compliant alternative exists.

FRAND: Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory

Patent Holder: An entity holding intellectual property relevant to PCS

Implementer: Any party implementing PCS specifications

Normative language follows RFC 2119.

5. Patent Disclosure
5.1 Disclosure Statement
Implementers are advised that one or more aspects of PCS may be covered by patents or patent applications owned by Persistra Inc. and/or other parties.
A non-exhaustive list of relevant patents and applications MAY be published separately.

5.2 No Warranty
This disclosure does not represent a warranty that PCS implementations are free of patent claims.

Implementers are responsible for conducting their own intellectual property assessments.

5.3 Patent Notice
See PATENT_NOTICE.md for further guidance.

6. Essential Patent Categories
Without limitation, implementation of one or more normative requirements of PCS MAY necessarily infringe patents with claims covering, including but not limited to::
Persistent cognitive state architectures
Multi-factor salience-based retrieval mechanisms
Deterministic policy enforcement
Cross-model cognitive continuity
Distributed and federated cognitive memory graphs

This categorization is illustrative, not exhaustive.

6.1 Essentiality Determination
Whether a patent claim is essential is a technical and legal determination that depends on the scope of PCS requirements implemented.

Essentiality MAY be assessed with respect to: • Specific PCS levels (L1–L4) • Specific normative requirements within a level • The absence of technically feasible, non-infringing alternatives

Exocortical Concepts, Inc. reserves the right to designate, update, or clarify essential patent status as PCS evolves.

7. Relationship Between PCS Compliance and Licensing
7.1 Specification vs Rights
PCS specifications define technical requirements, not legal rights.
Compliance with PCS does not itself grant patent licenses.

7.2 Certification Independence
PCS certification, as defined in RFC-PCS-0006, is independent of patent licensing.

Certification indicates technical conformance only.

8. FRAND Licensing Commitment
8.1 Licensing Intent
Persistra Inc. declares its intent to offer licenses to its patent claims that are essential to compliance with PCS normative requirements on FRAND terms.

8.2 Scope of FRAND
FRAND licensing applies to patents that are essential to PCS compliance.
Non-essential patents may be licensed separately.

8.3 No Automatic License
This declaration does not create an automatic license.

Licenses require mutual agreement and execution of appropriate legal instruments.

8.4 Standards-Essential Context
This framework is intended to align with established industry practices for standards-essential intellectual property, while preserving implementation flexibility and innovation.

Nothing in this document shall be construed as a waiver of rights, nor as a mandatory licensing obligation absent mutual agreement.

9. Licensing Considerations
FRAND licensing terms MAY consider factors including, but not limited to:
Scope of PCS level implemented (L1–L4)
Deployment scale
Commercial vs non-commercial use
Revenue derived from PCS-dependent functionality

Licensing terms SHOULD be consistent across similarly situated implementers.

10. Non-Discrimination
Licenses SHALL NOT be conditioned on:
Use of a particular LLM provider
Use of Persistra reference implementations
Participation in PCS governance

This ensures technology neutrality.

11. Defensive Suspension
Licenses MAY include defensive suspension provisions.
Such provisions MAY suspend licensing rights in the event of:
Patent litigation initiated by the licensee related to PCS

Defensive suspension terms SHOULD be reciprocal.

12. Disclosure Timing
Patent disclosure is provided prior to widespread PCS adoption.
This timing is intended to:
Avoid surprise licensing demands
Allow informed architectural decisions
Support good-faith implementation

13. Third-Party Patents
PCS may implicate patents held by third parties.
This document does not address third-party licensing obligations.

14. Antitrust Considerations
This framework is intended to comply with applicable competition laws.
PCS participation is voluntary.

Licensing discussions SHALL be conducted bilaterally and independently.

15. Updates and Transparency
Persistra Inc. MAY periodically update public patent disclosures.
Material changes SHOULD be publicly communicated.

16. Security Considerations
Patent licensing does not substitute for security evaluation.
Implementers remain responsible for secure deployment.

17. IANA Considerations
This document defines no IANA actions.

18. Conclusion
The PCS Patent Disclosure and FRAND Licensing Framework provides transparency and predictability for implementers while preserving innovation incentives.
By separating technical specification, certification, and licensing, PCS enables broad adoption without compromising intellectual property rights.
